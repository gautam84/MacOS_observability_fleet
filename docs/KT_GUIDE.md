# Knowledge Transfer Guide: Mac Mini Observability

## 1. Project overview

> This branch is the **no-sudo variant**: no sudo/admin rights, everything under the deployment user's home, per-user LaunchAgents instead of root LaunchDaemons, and no SSH observability. See [NO_SUDO_VARIANT.md](NO_SUDO_VARIANT.md) for the comparison with the system-level deployment and the LaunchAgent limitations.

This project uses Ansible to deploy host-metric observability to Apple Silicon Mac Minis. It solves the practical problem of seeing CPU, memory, filesystem, disk, network, and load information from multiple Macs in one place instead of logging in to each machine individually.

Ansible automates installation, directory creation, configuration rendering, dashboard provisioning, launchd plist creation, service requests, and basic verification. The design has two responsibilities: one monitoring Mac stores and displays metrics, while each worker/monitored Mac collects and sends its own metrics.

## 2. High-level architecture

The monitoring Mac runs VictoriaMetrics and Grafana. Every worker/monitored Mac runs OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib with the `hostmetrics` receiver.

```text
Mac Mini
  -> OpenTelemetry Collector
  -> hostmetrics
  -> resourcedetection
  -> batch
  -> OTLP/HTTP
  -> VictoriaMetrics
  -> Grafana
```

The collector exports to the monitoring Mac's VictoriaMetrics endpoint:

```text
http://<monitoring-server-address>:8428/opentelemetry/v1/metrics
```

See [architecture.svg](architecture.svg) for the visual overview.

## 3. Monitoring Mac versus worker Mac

| Machine | Installed components | Why it exists |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Monitoring Mac | VictoriaMetrics, Grafana, datasource/dashboard configuration, launchd plists | Stores fleet metrics and provides dashboards. |
| Worker/monitored Mac | OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib, collector configuration, launchd plist | Collects local host metrics and exports them to the monitoring Mac. |

The monitoring Mac is selected through the `monitoring_server` inventory group. Workers are members of `monitored_nodes`.

## 4. Ansible project structure

| Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `site.yml` | Defines the server play for `monitoring_server` and the agent play for `monitored_nodes`. |
| `inventories/production/hosts.yml` | Defines target Macs, their addresses, users, and group membership. |
| `inventories/production/group_vars/` | Holds the cross-role contract (`victoriametrics_port`, `monitoring_server_address`, auth settings), vault secret references, and per-environment overrides. |
| `roles/<role>/defaults/main.yml` | Holds versions, checksums, install paths, ports and tuning, so each role is self-contained. |
| `roles/observability_server/` | Installs and configures VictoriaMetrics and Grafana. |
| `roles/observability_agent/` | Installs and configures OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib. |
| `roles/observability_common/` | Shared building blocks used by both roles: the directory layout, the versioned-archive install flow, and the single launchd plist template. Never applied on its own. |
| `tasks/` | Ordered deployment and verification work. |
| `handlers/` | Restart requests triggered when relevant rendered files change. |
| `templates/` | Jinja2 templates for application configuration, provisioning, dashboards, and launchd plists. |

Ansible reads inventory and group variables for a target host, runs the matching role from `site.yml`, renders templates with those values, and places the result on the Mac.

## 5. Server role flow

When `observability_server` runs, it performs the following sequence:

1. Runs the preflight checks (not root; no sudo-variant LaunchDaemons for these services), then creates `~/tools/observability` directories for binaries, configuration, data, plugins, downloads, and logs, owned by the deployment user.
2. Writes the `0600` VictoriaMetrics basic-auth password file.
3. Downloads, checksum-verifies and extracts `victoria-metrics-prod` into a versioned directory, then repoints the stable `~/tools/observability/bin/victoria-metrics-prod` symlink at it.
4. Renders `com.observability.victoriametrics.plist` with the binary, data path, port, retention, the Prometheus-naming flag, and the auth credentials.
5. Downloads, checksum-verifies and extracts Grafana into a versioned directory, then repoints the `~/tools/observability/grafana` symlink.
6. Renders `grafana.ini` and the Grafana LaunchAgent plist in `~/Library/LaunchAgents`.
7. Provisions the VictoriaMetrics datasource, dashboard provider, the Mac Mini fleet dashboard, and the Mac Mini detail dashboard.
8. Bootstraps each LaunchAgent into the user's `user/<uid>` launchd domain if it is not loaded, then flushes handlers so verification sees the current configuration.
9. Verifies both health endpoints, that VictoriaMetrics accepts the configured credentials and rejects unauthenticated queries, the Grafana datasource API, and that the fleet and detail dashboards were provisioned.

VictoriaMetrics listens on the shared `victoriametrics_port` variable, currently `8428`. Grafana listens on the server-only `grafana_port`, currently `3000`.

## 6. Agent role flow

When `observability_agent` runs, it:

1. Asserts the `monitoring_server` group holds exactly one host with an address, runs the preflight checks, then creates the shared `~/tools/observability` directory structure.
2. Downloads and checksum-verifies the configured Darwin ARM64 `otelcol-contrib` archive.
3. Extracts it into a versioned directory, asserts the binary exists, and repoints the stable `~/tools/observability/bin/otelcol-contrib` symlink.
4. Renders `~/tools/observability/etc/otel-config.yaml` as `0600` (it carries the VictoriaMetrics password).
5. Renders `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.observability.otelcol.plist` with the binary, configuration, and log paths.
6. Bootstraps the collector into `user/<uid>` if it is not loaded, then flushes handlers.
7. Checks reachability to the monitoring Mac on port `8428`, validates the rendered configuration with `otelcol-contrib validate`, and waits for this Mac's metrics to actually appear in VictoriaMetrics.

## 7. OpenTelemetry in simple terms

OpenTelemetry Collector is a configurable telemetry process. It receives, processes, and exports telemetry; here it is used for host metrics and for latency to the monitoring Mac.

| Pipeline part | Meaning in this project |
| --- | --- |
| Receiver | The input component. `hostmetrics` reads metrics from the local macOS host. |
| `hostmetrics` | Collects CPU, memory, disk, filesystem, network, and load metrics every 15 seconds. |
| `tcp_check` | Times a TCP connect to VictoriaMetrics on the monitoring Mac every 15 seconds (`tcpcheck_duration_milliseconds`), which the dashboards show as latency. |
| Processor | Changes or prepares data before export. |
| `resourcedetection` | Adds system metadata, including the operating-system hostname used to identify the source Mac. |
| `batch` | Groups metrics before transmission to reduce individual export operations. |
| `otlphttp` | Sends metrics using the OpenTelemetry Protocol over HTTP. |

The project uses this native collector pipeline instead of a Node Exporter/Prometheus-based collection path. This keeps the collection path focused on the OpenTelemetry configuration that is already deployed.

## 8. VictoriaMetrics

VictoriaMetrics is the monitoring Mac's metric storage service. It receives the metric payloads sent by agents, stores them under `~/tools/observability/var/victoriametrics`, and exposes a health endpoint.

The configured OTLP/HTTP ingestion endpoint is:

```text
/opentelemetry/v1/metrics
```

The full endpoint includes the inventory-derived monitoring-server address and port `8428`. Historical metric storage grows with the number of workers, their metric volume, the 15-second collection interval, retention, and metric cardinality.

## 9. Grafana

Grafana is the visualization layer. The server role provisions a VictoriaMetrics datasource and two dashboards. **Mac Mini Fleet Overview** shows every host on shared panels (CPU, memory, disk, network, load, latency to the monitoring Mac) with a **Mac Mini** selector to narrow them. Clicking a host's series or its name in the Hosts table opens **Mac Mini Detail**, one reusable dashboard that takes the host as a variable.

Grafana's configuration is rendered under `~/tools/observability/etc/grafana`, its application is under `~/tools/observability/grafana`, and its service listens on port `3000` by default.

## 10. End-to-end example

If CPU use increases on Worker Mac 01:

1. `hostmetrics` collects the local CPU metric.
2. The collector applies `resourcedetection`, then `batch`.
3. `otlphttp` sends the metric to the monitoring Mac.
4. VictoriaMetrics receives and persists the metric.
5. Grafana queries VictoriaMetrics when the dashboard refreshes.
6. The CPU panel displays the changed value for that host.

## 11. First-time deployment

Use one monitoring Mac and one worker Mac for the first real-world test.

1. Prepare the monitoring Mac with SSH access for the deployment user (no sudo needed); check ports `8428` and `3000` are available.
2. Add the monitoring Mac and one worker to the inventory.
3. Run the server play: `ansible-playbook -i inventories/production/hosts.yml site.yml --tags server`.
4. Verify VictoriaMetrics at `http://localhost:8428/health` on the monitoring Mac.
5. Verify Grafana at `http://<monitoring-mac-address>:3000` and confirm its datasource.
6. Prepare one worker Mac with SSH access and network reachability to the monitoring Mac on port `8428`.
7. Run the agent play with the worker inventory alias in `--limit`.
8. Validate the collector configuration and check the collector log.
9. Confirm metrics reach VictoriaMetrics.
10. Confirm the worker appears in Grafana.
11. Only then add additional Macs.

## 12. Scaling to N Mac Minis

The final fleet size is not fixed. To scale, add each Mac to `monitored_nodes` in the inventory and run the same agent role:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventories/production/hosts.yml site.yml --tags agent
```

To stage deployment or troubleshoot one Mac, use its inventory alias:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventories/production/hosts.yml site.yml --limit <worker-alias> --tags agent
```

No new role is needed for more Macs. Inventory membership determines where `observability_agent` runs.

## 13. launchd

`launchd` is macOS's native service manager. This variant renders **per-user LaunchAgent** plists into `~/Library/LaunchAgents` for:

- `com.observability.victoriametrics`
- `com.observability.grafana`
- `com.observability.otelcol`

All three are rendered from a single shared template, `roles/observability_common/templates/launchd_agent.plist.j2`. Each calling role supplies the label, the `ProgramArguments` list (kept in that role's `defaults/main.yml`) and the log paths, so the plists cannot drift apart. `ansible.builtin.service` has no macOS implementation, so the roles drive `launchctl` directly, always in the deployment user's own `user/<uid>` domain and never `system/`: bootstrap-if-not-loaded on install, and bootout+bootstrap on restart.

The plists set `LimitLoadToSessionType` to `Background`. Without it, launchd refuses to let a non-admin user bootstrap them into `user/<uid>`. Unlike root LaunchDaemons, **LaunchAgents are not started at boot**, so re-run the play for a Mac after it reboots. [NO_SUDO_VARIANT.md](NO_SUDO_VARIANT.md#launchagent-lifecycle) covers logout, reboot and the optional `gui` domain.

## 14. Variables and dynamic configuration

The configuration flow is:

```text
inventory -> group_vars -> role task -> Jinja2 template -> final configuration on the Mac
```

For example, `monitoring_server_address` is derived from the first host in the `monitoring_server` inventory group. The agent's collector template combines that address with `victoriametrics_port` to form its export endpoint. This is why roles and templates do not contain a real environment address.

## 15. Security

- Use SSH keys or an approved SSH authentication mechanism for Ansible access.
- The Ansible user needs **no** sudo privileges: installation paths and LaunchAgent plists are all in that user's home directory. Do not grant sudo for this deployment.
- **By default this project ships with no auth on either service**: `victoriametrics_auth_enabled: false` and a plain, checked-in `grafana_admin_password: admin`. This is intended for local/testing use only — anyone able to reach port 8428 can read, write or delete fleet metrics, and Grafana logs in with the default credentials.
- For anything beyond local testing, set `victoriametrics_auth_enabled: true` with a real username/password, and replace `grafana_admin_password` with a real value — plain or via Ansible Vault (`ansible-vault encrypt_string`).
- Do not commit real passwords, private keys, or production credentials to Git.
- Limit access to ports `8428` and `3000` according to the management network policy.

## 16. Automated, manual, and real-Mac work

| Category | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Automated by Ansible | Directories, downloads, archive extraction, templates, datasource/dashboard provisioning, plist creation, service requests, and verification tasks. |
| Manual initial setup | Select Macs, prepare inventory, provide SSH access (no sudo), optionally set real credentials (plain or vaulted) if enabling auth, and permit network access. |
| Requires real-Mac validation | Deployment over real SSH, LaunchAgents surviving SSH logout and reboots, runtime permissions, firewall policy, service health, and end-to-end metric ingestion. |

## 17. Common teammate questions

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Why Ansible? | It applies the same installation and configuration steps consistently across Macs. |
| Why two roles? | The monitoring server and workers have different responsibilities and installed software. |
| Why not one role per technology? | The current two-role split maps to deployment responsibility while keeping the project small. |
| Why OpenTelemetry? | The current design uses one collector pipeline for host metrics and OTLP/HTTP export. |
| Why `hostmetrics`? | It collects the required local system metrics on each worker Mac. |
| Why not Node Exporter? | It is not part of this design; the configured collector `hostmetrics` receiver provides the required host metrics. |
| Why not Prometheus? | It is not part of this design; VictoriaMetrics receives OTLP/HTTP metrics directly. |
| Why is the collector version pinned so specifically? | On macOS the `cpu` and `disk` scrapers were unimplemented until well after 0.98.0. Below 0.159.0 the CPU and disk panels cannot populate at all. |
| Why does VictoriaMetrics need a naming flag? | Without `-opentelemetry.usePrometheusNaming` it stores OTLP names verbatim (`system.memory.usage`, label `host.name`), which matches no dashboard query. |
| Does VictoriaMetrics need a password? | It has no authentication of its own, so anyone able to reach port 8428 can read, write or delete fleet metrics. Auth is off by default (`victoriametrics_auth_enabled: false`) for local/testing use; set it to `true` with real credentials for anything beyond that. |
| Why VictoriaMetrics? | It is the configured metric store and supports the required OTLP/HTTP ingestion endpoint. |
| Why Grafana? | It provides the configured datasource and dashboards for metric visualization. |
| Why one monitoring Mac? | The inventory has one `monitoring_server` target that centralizes storage and visualization. |
| How do workers know where to send metrics? | The address is derived from the `monitoring_server` inventory group and rendered into the collector config. |
| How does the project scale to N Macs? | Add hosts to `monitored_nodes` and reuse the same agent role. |
| What happens if the monitoring Mac is down? | Agents cannot deliver metrics to its endpoint; review collector logs and restore monitoring-Mac availability. |
| Where are metrics stored? | In VictoriaMetrics under `~/tools/observability/var/victoriametrics` on the monitoring Mac. |
| Is SSH access monitored? | Not in this variant. SSH observability was removed; Ansible still uses SSH to manage the Macs. |
| What happens if a collector stops? | That Mac stops exporting new metrics until the collector service is restored. |
| What needs real-Mac testing? | launchd behavior, binaries, permissions, networking, health checks, and end-to-end metrics. |

## 18. KT talking points

Use this short flow during the session:

1. “We have one monitoring Mac and any number of worker Macs.”
2. “Workers collect their own host metrics every 15 seconds with OpenTelemetry Collector.”
3. “The collector adds host identity, batches the metrics, and sends them over OTLP/HTTP.”
4. “VictoriaMetrics on the monitoring Mac stores the data, and Grafana visualizes it.”
5. “Inventory determines which Mac is the monitoring server and which Macs are workers; templates turn those values into configuration.”
6. “We first prove the setup with one monitoring Mac and one worker, then add workers by inventory.”
7. “The remaining risk is real macOS runtime validation, especially launchd.”

## 19. Real environment and no-hardcoding handoff

The repository is a template for a real environment. It avoids embedding environment-specific values in roles and templates. A new engineer must provide the following:

- Real Mac Mini hostnames or reachable addresses in `inventories/production/hosts.yml`.
- The correct `ansible_user` for every Mac.
- SSH key/authentication access for that user (no sudo permission needed).
- Exactly one Mac assigned to `monitoring_server`.
- All collector Macs assigned to `monitored_nodes`.
- A reachable monitoring-Mac address; agents derive this from the selected monitoring-server inventory host.
- A real Grafana admin password (`grafana_admin_password`, plain or vaulted) if the checked-in default (`admin`) is not acceptable for the target environment.
- `victoriametrics_auth_enabled: true` plus a real username/password if VictoriaMetrics needs auth (it ships disabled). The collector on every Mac, the Grafana datasource and VictoriaMetrics itself are all rendered from the same credentials, so all three must be deployed from the same source.
- Any legitimate environment changes to base paths, ports, or versions in group variables. The default paths and ports should only be changed when the environment requires it.

Template inventory:

```text
monitoring_server:
  placeholder-host

monitored_nodes:
  placeholder-node-01
  placeholder-node-02
```

Real-environment shape:

```text
monitoring_server:
  <monitoring-mac-alias>  (ansible_host: <monitoring-mac-address>)

monitored_nodes:
  <worker-mac-01-alias>  (ansible_host: <worker-mac-01-address>)
  <worker-mac-02-alias>  (ansible_host: <worker-mac-02-address>)
```

Use placeholders and a secure inventory/secret process for real values; do not place production credentials in this guide or in the role templates.
